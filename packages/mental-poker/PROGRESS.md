- ‚úÖ Complete card masking/unmasking cycle
- ‚úÖ Multi-party key generation and aggregation

- [x] **Error Handling**: Identical error cases and messages
- [x] **Parameter Validation**: Same validation logic as Rust implementation
- [x] **Unmask Behavior**: Supports partial reveals (any number of tokens)

## Post-Audit Improvements üîÑ

### Security Enhancements Completed
- [x] **Enhanced Bayer-Groth Verification**: Improved algebraic checks and ciphertext consistency verification
- [x] **Secure Pedersen Parameters**: Replaced ad-hoc generation with proper hash-to-curve using domain separation
- [x] **Secure Randomness**: Fixed polynomial generation to use `randScalar()` instead of `crypto.getRandomValues()`
- [x] **Error Handling**: Removed console.error from cryptographic functions, using proper error propagation
- [x] **Documentation Updates**: Updated PROGRESS.md to reflect current security status

### Known Security Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Incomplete Shuffle Verification**: While significantly improved, the Bayer-Groth verification still uses simplified checks for some polynomial relations. Full verification would require complete polynomial arithmetic validation.
- **Custom ZK Proofs**: The masking, reveal, and key ownership proofs are custom implementations that should undergo formal security review.
- **Modular Inverse**: Uses custom implementation that should be reviewed for side-channel resistance.

## Next Priority Tasks üìã

1. **Complete Bayer-Groth Implementation** (High Priority)
   - Implement full polynomial relation verification
   - Add complete ciphertext-permutation consistency checks
   - Ensure cryptographic soundness of shuffle proofs

2. **Security Review** (High Priority)
   - Formal review of custom ZK-proof implementations
   - Side-channel analysis of modular inverse implementation
   - Comprehensive security testing

3. **Documentation & Testing** (Medium Priority)
   - Add comprehensive API documentation
   - Create integration tests comparing against Rust implementation
   - Document security assumptions and limitations

## Technical Debt üîß

- [ ] **DTS Generation**: Currently disabled due to path mapping complexity
- [ ] **Error Context**: Add more detailed error messages and context
- [ ] **Performance Profiling**: Benchmark operations for optimization opportunities
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Optimize for large deck operations

## Architecture Decisions üìê

### World-Class TypeScript Patterns Applied
